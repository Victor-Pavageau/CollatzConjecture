## About

This Python script was developed as part of a personal challenge to explore the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the Syracuse problem, using a brute-force approach. The conjecture, which suggests that no matter which positive integer you start with, applying a set of simple operations (divide by 2 for even numbers, multiply by 3 and add 1 for odd numbers) will eventually lead to the number 1, remains unproven.

In less than 2 hours, this script was developed, tested, and optimized to search for potential solutions or patterns. While it does not prove or disprove the conjecture, the script attempts to explore different numbers and track the iterations needed to reach 1.

## Installation

To install and run the Collatz Conjecture script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Victor-Pavageau/CollatzConjecture.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd CollatzConjecture
```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python installed.

## Usage

To start the Collatz Conjecture script, simply run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can now enter the initial number of your choice and get the log as the script is running.
